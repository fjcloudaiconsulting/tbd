"""Redis / Valkey client — singleton, lazy-initialized from settings.

Scope today: MFA email-code single-use nonces + refresh-session primary
key, grace key, and family set (``auth:session:{jti}``,
``auth:session:grace:{jti}``, ``auth:session:by_sid:{sid}``).
More features (rate-limit storage, cache) land here when the app moves
off single-replica on DO App Platform and needs shared state.

Behavior when `settings.redis_url` is empty:
- Development: `get_client()` returns `None`. Callers must handle None and
  decide whether to skip the Redis-backed check (usually yes in dev).
- Production: a runtime warning is logged at startup. The security-critical
  callers (MFA nonce, auth-session writes) MUST fail closed if they need
  Redis and it's missing; see `require_client()` below.

    Idempotent. The client is shared across the process lifetime, the
    underlying connection pool handles concurrency.

    Resilience knobs explained:
    - `socket_keepalive=True`: lets the kernel detect dead peers (Valkey
      restart, droplet reboot, VPC route flap) instead of waiting for the
      next read to time out three seconds in.
    - `health_check_interval=30`: redis-py pings idle pooled connections
      every 30s and discards any that fail, so a Valkey restart does not
      leave half-open sockets sitting in the pool waiting to time out a
      future caller.
    - `retry_on_error` + `retry`: one short backoff retry on connect or
      timeout errors. This makes the dashboard probe and the MFA nonce
      path tolerate a Valkey blip (e.g. an Ansible re-converge that
      bounces the service) instead of surfacing a hard failure on the
      very first stale-pool socket. ``OSError`` (covers
      ``ConnectionResetError`` and ``BrokenPipeError``) is in the retry
      list because production observed those classes on idle-dropped
      sockets — the 2026-05-19T07:10 trace. We deliberately do NOT add
      bare ``RuntimeError`` here because redis-py's retry contract is
      "drop connection + reconnect on listed error"; widening to all
      ``RuntimeError`` would also retry genuine programmer bugs. The
      transport-runtime case is handled instead by the
      ``_normalize_transport_errors`` wrapper at the helper layer.

    Fail-fast budget (2026-05-19 production trace):

    With the values defined above, the worst-case time a single Redis
    call spends inside the retry machinery is::

        socket_timeout + retries * (socket_timeout + backoff_cap)
        = 1.0 + 1 * (1.0 + 0.2)
        = 2.2 s

    ``/auth/refresh`` does up to 4 sequential Redis calls in the grace
    branch (validate + grace + family_exists + family_member from the
    catch-up helper), so the absolute upper bound is ~8.8 s — well
    under the frontend's 45 s reactive-recovery timer. A transient VPC
    blip now surfaces as a fast 503 the frontend retries, not a
    "(canceled)" that locks the user out for a full timeout window.

    Earlier values (socket_timeout=3, retries=2, cap=1.0) summed to
    ~11 s per call, ~44 s for /refresh — exactly the hang the
    operator observed on 2026-05-19 at 15:25–15:42 UTC. Tests in
    ``test_auth_redis_failfast_budget.py`` pin the new ceiling so any
    future change that re-inflates the budget is caught in CI.

# replayed. The jti embedded in the email JWT is recorded in Redis at
# issue time AND deleted on first successful verify. 0 == not found ==
# replay attempt → 401.

# so the ``_normalize_transport_errors`` wrapper covers the MFA path
# too — without this layer, a closed-transport RuntimeError during
# /mfa/email-verify produces a 500 instead of a recoverable 503.
#
# Both helpers return ``None`` when Redis isn't configured (dev mode);
# production callers MUST check for that and fail closed with 503.
